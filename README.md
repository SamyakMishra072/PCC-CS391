# PCC-CS391: Data Structures & Algorithms Lab

This repository contains all the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) codes implemented during my 3rd semester as part of the **PCC-CS391** course in the **B.Tech Computer Science & Engineering** curriculum.

## 📘 Course Overview

**PCC-CS391** is a core lab course designed to strengthen the understanding of fundamental data structures and their applications through hands-on programming. It covers implementation of key data structures, algorithmic logic, and solving problems using efficient coding practices.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

The repository includes implementations of:

- ✅ Arrays and Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- ✅ Stacks and Queues (Array and Linked List based)
- ✅ Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Traversals)
- ✅ Graphs (Adjacency Matrix/List, DFS, BFS)
- ✅ Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort)
- ✅ Searching Algorithms (Linear and Binary Search)
- ✅ Recursion and Backtracking Problems
- ✅ Hashing (Basics and Collision Handling)
- ✅ Time and Space Complexity Analysis

> 📌 All codes are written in **C language**, following a modular and clean coding style for better readability.

> Each folder contains relevant `.c` source files along with necessary comments explaining the logic and approach.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamyakMishra072/PCC-CS391.git
